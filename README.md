## 🔬 Medical Context

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide. Early detection through accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to assist medical professionals in making more consistent and accurate diagnoses based on quantitative cell nucleus analysis.

### 🩺 Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)

The dataset is based on FNA samples, a minimally invasive procedure that:

- Uses a thin needle to extract cell samples from breast masses
- Provides cell nucleus characteristics for analysis
- Enables computer-aided diagnosis to support medical decisions

## 📊 Dataset

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset contains 569 samples with 30 features each, derived from digitized images of FNA samples. Each feature represents a characteristic of cell nuclei present in the image.

### Feature Categories

1. **Radius**: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
2. **Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
3. **Perimeter**: Nucleus perimeter measurements
4. **Area**: Nucleus area measurements
5. **Smoothness**: Local variation in radius lengths
6. **Compactness**: Perimeter² / area - 1.0
7. **Concavity**: Severity of concave portions of the contour
8. **Concave Points**: Number of concave portions of the contour
9. **Symmetry**: Nucleus symmetry measurements
10. **Fractal Dimension**: "Coastline approximation" - 1

Each category includes:

- **Mean**: Average value
- **Standard Error**: Standard error of the mean
- **Worst**: Mean of the three largest values
